# ExampleMod

This mod serves as both an example implementation and a testing mod for KeybindLib.

Check out [`Main.cs`](./Main.cs) for the mod's entry point, [`Keybinds.cs`](./Keybinds.cs) for the actual example, or [`modinfo.json`](./modinfo.json).

If you have any questions, feel free to message me on Discord (`Esper#8989`) or matrix (`@esper89:matrix.org`).

## Features
(For testing purposes)

 - `key.test` (Test, `T`): Creates messages in the console when pressed, held down, released, and repeated.

 - `key.jest` (Jest, `J`): Tries (and fails) to start your jetpack, causing a small loss of energy.

 - `key.kest` (Kest, `K`): Does nothing at all. Has no translations either. "Kest" isn't even a word.

 - `key.vest` (Vest, `V`): Makes you start running.

 - `key.nest` (Nest, `N`): Causes you to jump, but does not start the jetpack. Does not require you to press it again to jump again.

 - `key.jump` (Jump, `Space`): The vanilla jump action, but it prints `Thanks for jumping!` in the console upon release.
