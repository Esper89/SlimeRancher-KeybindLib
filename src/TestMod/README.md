# TestMod

This mod serves as both an example implementation and a test mod for KeybindLib. You can also refer to the GitHub wiki (`.github/wiki`) or the main README for more information.

Check out `Main.cs` for the mod's entry point, `Keybinds.cs` for the actual example, or `modinfo.json`.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me on Discord (`Esper#8989`) or matrix (`@esper89:matrix.org`).
